Today, many people spend a lot of time working with their computers, often leading to eye fatigue. Fortunately, there is a trick called the 20-20-20 rule where a person for every 20 minutes, looks at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. The application below attempts to provide users with reminders that follow the rule and attempts to relieve some eye strain.
